# Algorithm Visualizer
#### By Joshua Maitland

Algorithm Visualizer is a tool that illustrates the way that algorithms sort a set of data. 
The following algorithms have been implemented with more to come.

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort

## How It Works

On the main menu you will be presented with a selection of algorithms. Select one by clicking
the associated button. A set of data represented by bars of varying lengths will be randomized,
and slowly sorted in ascending order.
